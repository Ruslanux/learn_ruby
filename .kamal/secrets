# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password, env/secret, builder/secrets,
# and accessories/*/env/secret in config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either
# password manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file needs to be safe for git.

# Option 1: For local development/manual deploy - set these in your shell:
# export KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=your_dockerhub_token
# export DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password

# Option 2: For GitHub Actions - secrets are passed via environment variables

# Grab the registry password from ENV
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Database password from ENV
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$DATABASE_PASSWORD

# Rails master key - from ENV or file
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=${RAILS_MASTER_KEY:-$(cat config/master.key 2>/dev/null || echo "")}
